SYNOPSIS
      use base qw(CGI::Application);
      use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

      __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        DRIVER => [ 'CDBI',
          CLASS   => 'My::CDBI::Users',
          FIELD_METHODS => [qw(user MD5:passphrase)]
        ],
        CREDENTIALS => [qw(auth_username auth_password)],
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This Authentication driver uses the Class::DBI module to allow you to
    authenticate against any Class::DBI class.

PARAMETERS
    The Class::DBI authentication driver accepts the following required
    parameters.

  CLASS (required)
    Specifies the Class::DBI class to use for authentication. This class
    must be loaded prior to use.

  FIELD_METHODS (required)
    FIELD_METHODS is an arrayref of the methods in the Class::DBI class
    specified by CLASS to be used during authentication. The order of these
    methods needs to match the order of the CREDENTIALS. For example, if
    CREDENTIALS is set to:

      CREDENTIALS => [qw(auth_user auth_domain auth_password)]

    Then FIELD_METHODS must be set to:

      FIELD_METHODS => [qw(userid domain password)]

    FIELD_METHODS supports filters as specified by
    CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver

METHODS
  verify_credentials
    This method will test the provided credentials against the values found
    in the database, according to the Driver configuration.
